# Epic File Conversion
Set of test files used for developing a workflow for Epic Files
This is only a select set of files uploaded.  
These files are the starting point to customize to suit your environment.
This is an example of the testing I developed before we began recieving live Epic Files
in order to update and develope further to suit our needs with the established backend already in place.
