# Epic File Conversion
Set of test files used for developing a workflow for Epic Files
The purpose is to extract data from a file on a network drive and rearange it in multiple files.
This is only a select set of files uploaded.  
These files are the starting point for anyone to customize to suit thier environment.
This is an example of the testing I developed before we began recieving live Epic Files
in order to update and develope further to suit our needs with the established backend already in place.
I shared what I think display few of the methods I am familiar with and the changess 
or process I went through before we went live Without others input.  
Time was short and we needed to quickly make it work first before going back to cleanup the code.
The scripts are ran in a cron task over and involve a shared network drive.
With permission I will upload an up to date version of our conversion script.
