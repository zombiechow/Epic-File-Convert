# Epic File Conversion
Set of test files used for developing a workflow for Epic Files
The purpose is to extract data from a file on a network drive and rearange it in multiple files on the server.
This is only a select set of files uploaded. Strictly a limit of the work that I developed and can share openly.
Most of the work I do is on updating code for changes or converting to python 3.

With permission I will upload an up to date version of our conversion script and possibly other scripts.
